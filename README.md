# Enamel
## Rework

Enamel was orignially a replacement for Android's XML layout system. However, with the introdcution of Jetpack compose, the need for an alternative way of building UI is not as important as it used to be when this project was started.

Some of the elements in this library can still be used, the layout system has been thought of to work regardless of the UI system, also the geometry module has some great features that can be particularly useful when working with a Canvas.

## New goal

Android's Canvas API is very powerful but also very hard to use, especially when multiple shapes, multi-touch and animations are involved.
Enamel will provide a simple way of doing all of this
